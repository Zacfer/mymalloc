Simple implementation of malloc
========

This is an implementation of an efficient memory allocation function, where the memory to be allocated is an (int) array
that is passed to the program.

This project was the coursework for the "Operating Systems" course for my undergraduate degree.

In order to test the efficiency of the program use the test harness in the "public_test" folder, by running the make file.

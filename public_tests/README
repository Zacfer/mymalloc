These files contain test code for the COMP2009 coursework. You are to do your final testing
on linuxproj.

Instructions
------------
1. Place your mymalloc.c, mymalloc.h and mymalloc_threadsafe.c in this directory. 
If you don't yet have a mymalloc_threadsafe.c, for now use a copy of your mymalloc.c, i.e. type
	
	cp mymalloc.c mymalloc_threadsafe.c

2. Run make. Two executables are produced

	runtests - runs a standard test. Feel free to change the SEED and SIZE parameters in 
			   the Makefile. I will run this test with several different values of SIZE and 
			   SEED as part of the marking process.
			   
	runthreadedtests - runs a multithreaded test where your functions are called simultanously
				from several different threads. In addition to SEED and SIZE, feel free to 
				change the THREADS parameter (the number of threads) and the OPS parameter 
				(the number of mymalloc/myfree calls per thread)
				
If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
